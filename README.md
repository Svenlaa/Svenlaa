# 👋🏻 Hello there,

I'm Sven Lammertink, a web developer based in Overijssel, the Netherlands 🇳🇱. I build anything on the web you can imagine. This stretches from websites to [tv apps](https://www.bandwerk.nl/succesverhalen/concept-tv) to [booking kiosks](https://www.bandwerk.nl/succesverhalen/leisurekingboekingszuil). 

## Technologies
- PHP
- React
- Javascript
- Typescript
- Hono

## Hobbies and interests
I like watching running, learning 日本語 🇯🇵, coding, jigsaws, and reading books.

I follow the push for European tech very closely, from AI and European Cloud to payment processing. Part of this overlaps with my intereset of decentralisation and self hosting.
